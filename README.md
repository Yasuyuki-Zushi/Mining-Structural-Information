# Mining-Structural-Information

The R codes used in the paper "Mining structural information in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry data for analytical-descriptor-based quantitative structureâ€“activity relationship" are provided in the "Mining-Structural-Information".

"tsne_demo" provides the code to perform clustering using t-SNE.
"xgboost_demo" provides the code to perform QSAR modeling based on XGBoost and prediction by them.

Users can easily perform calculations by downloading the demo folders with providing your R working directory in the code.
In "tsne_demo", the number of input data is reduced to 1/10 for the rapid demonstration of calculation. Users can execute it with all data by adjusting input value "demo.data.proportion" to be 1.

QSAR modeling and prediction on molecular weight, or t-SNE clustering with PubChem fingerprint are provided for the purpose of demonstration.
